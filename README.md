A simple emoji picker
[Progressive Web App](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Introduction)
with search functionality to easily find and copy your favorite ‚ô•Ô∏è emojis! Use the search
box üîç to filter for the emoji you are looking for, and click on it to easily copy to the
clipboard üìã. Consider installing the application on your device (or add to home screen)
for additional emoji goodness ü§ó!

# Local Development

Install the development environment with:

```shell
$ npm ci
```

Run the application locally with:

```shell
$ npm start
# Open your browser to http://localhost:4200/
```

# Testing

Run tests with:

```
$ npm test
```

Though I got pretty lazy with tests here, so TBH there's not much there.

# Deployments

$ npm run -s deploy -- --site "${SITE_ID}" --prod
```
