  * Assets must start with project source root in the path, can't do generated assets.
  * Tried to symlink to generated asset, but Webpack devserver doesn't like that?
  * Assets can rename directories, but not files?
* `.gitignore` ends up in generated assets.
* Zone doesn't monkey patch `ResizeObserver`?
* Using styles and passing context through `MatSnackbar` and `ng-template` is actually quite straightforward.
  * Doing this manually is quite tricky to get right, particularly with style isolation.
